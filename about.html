                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>
                       Continuous Integration and Automated Testing (C.I.A.T.) is a Baserock
                       initiative that creates a Linux based operating system using existing
                       Open Source software through an automated heart-beat pipeline process
                       with 6 main stages:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Detection of a new version of a component included in our customised OS.</li>
                        <li>Integration of the update into the OS definition.</li>
                        <li>Creation a new build based on the updated definition.</li>
                        <li>Preparation of the builds/images and artifacts and provision of a bare-metal or VM farm for (automated) testing.</li>
                        <li>Test the build.</li>
                        <li>Publication of the candidate and the associated artifacts, making them ready for verification and validation.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The idea behind Baserock, implemented in CIAT, is to integrate the
                        latest software from relevant upstream projects as soon as they
                        release it. Staying as close to upstream as possible simplifies
                        integration and maintenance at big scale.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Implementation</h4>
                    <p>In the current implementation, CIAT is divided in five main stages:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Integration:</strong>
                            <p>This is the process that check if the there are upstream changes relevant to our customized OS and upgrade (integrate) those changes in the definitions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Build:</strong>
                            <p>Building stage. In the current implementation we are dealing with two different builds, a GENIVI based demo platform and a ARM base image.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Image creation:</strong>
                            <p>Creation of the image out of the build and store it, together with the different artifacts required in a file server so they are available for further stages.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Provision and test:</strong>
                            <p>Once published, VMs are created and deployed in a cloud so test can be run automatically.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Publish candidate:</strong>
                            <p>If tests pass, the image is declared as candidate, together with the artifacts, published and announced.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        CIAT currently automatically attempts to integrate and build when it
                        detects new commits in systemd or the Linux kernel, and shows whether
                        or not the tests still pass with those new versions.
                    </p>

                        By clicking in each box, you can access to further information about
                        the process currently running and the previous one, including logs,
                        together with a summary of recent processes. You will identify which
                        process are in execution state by an animation and a progress bar.
                        All this information will help you, not just to get context of what
                        is happening, but also to analyse failures.
